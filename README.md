# jQuery Mobile for Web Works Sample App

The snapshots folder has the sample app at different stages of completion.

The session number in the folder signifies what snapshot lines up with the *start* of that session, not the end. 

The final snapshot is named `snapshot_completed`.

The `src` folder matches the contents of the `snapshot_03` folder.
